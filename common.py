  * v_svm  solves  min ||theta||^2  s.t.  y theta.r >= 1  (Def. r-separability).
           Group r-margins gamma-tilde_g are read off THIS scaling, so that
           min_g gamma-tilde_g = 1 as the manuscript's WLOG requires.
  * v_hat = v_svm / ||v_svm||  is the UNIT vector. The isotropic-regime
           eigenvalue conditions (Def. Isotropic Regime) are statements about a
           unit eigenvector, so mu_A = ||A v_hat||^2 etc. are computed with

    Implements Definition (r-separability):

        v = argmin ||theta||^2   s.t.   P(y theta.r >= 1) = 1,

    as a hard-margin linear SVM without intercept on the r-block. We use a
    large-C soft-margin solver rather than a strict hard-margin QP because on
    real frozen features the r-block is not guaranteed to be separable; `C` is
    taken large enough that the solution is numerically hard-margin whenever
    separability does hold.

    The manuscript defines the group r-margins as essential infima,

        gamma-tilde_g := ess inf_{r | G_g}  y v.r .

    The empirical plug-in for an ess-inf is the sample minimum, but the sample
    minimum is driven by a single point and is badly non-robust on real data.
    We therefore report the `quantile`-level lower quantile as the primary
    estimate (default 1%) and expose the raw minimum for comparison. Both are
    returned so the sensitivity can be stated openly.

    The manuscript's WLOG sets the SMALLER of the two group r-margins to 1. We
    renormalise to enforce that, and record whether the data is in the
    "standard" orientation (gamma-tilde_min >= gamma-tilde_maj, i.e. the
    minority holds the geometric margin advantage) or in the "mirror" case, for
    which the manuscript prescribes substituting (mu_A, gamma-tilde_min) <-
    (mu_B, gamma-tilde_maj).

    A note on the solver tolerances. An earlier version used tol=1e-9 with
    max_iter=200_000. At C=1e6 liblinear's dual coordinate descent cannot drive
    the dual violation anywhere near 1e-9, so `n_iter_` hit `max_iter` on every
    input tested: the solver always burned all 200,000 passes over the data and
    then returned a non-converged `v` regardless. That is a fixed cost of
    minutes at d_r in the hundreds and over ten minutes at d_r ~ 2000, bought
    nothing, and -- because it never converged -- gave no accuracy guarantee to
    trade away. tol=1e-4 with max_iter=20_000 is an attainable stopping
    criterion rather than an unreachable one. If liblinear still warns about
    convergence, that is informative: it means the r-block is far from
    separable at this C, which is exactly the situation the RuntimeWarning
    below is meant to surface.

    Determinism (`seed`)
    --------------------
    `LinearSVC` defaults to `random_state=None`, and with `loss="hinge"` the
    solver is dual coordinate descent, which SHUFFLES the order in which
    coordinates are updated using that generator. Leaving it unset therefore
    made this function non-deterministic: repeated fits on byte-identical input
    returned different directions, and because `level` is read off a quantile of
    the resulting margins, the group r-margins gamma-tilde_g -- and hence alpha,
    which is linear in them -- inherited that variation directly. Measured on
    one bundle, the 1% quantile margin ranged over [0.367, 0.925] across four
    identical calls; with `random_state` fixed the four agreed to every digit.

    On the Waterbirds raw/two-concept split this moved alpha from 0.811 to 1.144
    between two runs of unchanged code -- across the alpha = 1 boundary that
    separates the manuscript's two regimes. Seeding makes the number
    REPRODUCIBLE; it does not make it stable. The underlying cause is that at
    C = 1e6 the problem is close to degenerate and the solve does not converge,
    so different coordinate orders stop in different places. The real remedy is
    to solve the hard-margin program directly, which has a unique solution
    whenever the r-block separates -- and when it does not separate, `v` does
    not exist and the honest output is the non-estimable branch below.

    WHY THIS EXISTS
    ---------------
    The manuscript defines gamma-tilde_g as an essential infimum, i.e. it asks
    for  P(y v.r >= 1) = 1  exactly. The separability probe shows the best
    achievable held-out accuracy on this representation is about 0.94, so a
    proxy quantile of 1% -- which demands 99% of points on the correct side --
    can never be met in the population, and alpha is then refused for a reason
    that has nothing to do with the geometry it is meant to describe.

    Sweeping the quantile turns that binary failure into a reported sensitivity:
    at which q does the r-block become separable, and how does alpha move with
    q once it is? A q chosen above the population error rate gives a q-RELAXED
    r-separability under which alpha is estimable, with the approximation
    stated rather than hidden.

    WHY NO REFIT IS NEEDED
    ----------------------
    `fit_margin_direction` divides v twice, first by `level` and then by `base`,
    and both are positive scalars whenever the block separates. A positive
    rescaling does not move a direction, so `v_hat` is INDEPENDENT of the
    quantile. Moreover gamma-tilde is a RATIO of two per-group quantiles of the
    same margin vector, so the `level` division cancels out of it entirely.
    Everything that changes with q can therefore be recomputed from the margins
    of the existing direction, and the SVM -- the expensive part, minutes at
    d_r in the thousands -- is fitted once for the whole sweep.

    By the same argument `iso_diagnostics` is q-independent: it consumes only
    `v_hat`. So mu_A', mu', dim K and d* are shared across the sweep, and only
    gamma-tilde moves.

    Returns a MarginFit carrying the same direction with gamma-tilde,
    separability and orientation recomputed at `quantile`.

    A'^T = A^T - v u_A^T, the extra term is parallel to v and is annihilated by
    Pi_bar_v, so ker(Pi_bar_v . A'^T) = ker(Pi_bar_v . A^T). The kernel does not
    move when we reparametrise.

    Minimising the displacement (39) over A'v, B'v in K is then an orthogonal
    projection onto K, giving

        A'v = Pi_K (A v),   B'v = Pi_K (B v),
        d*  = K_sup ( ||Pi_{K^perp} (A v)|| + ||Pi_{K^perp} (B v)|| ).    (40)

    We return the projections themselves and not merely the residual norm: they
    are what Section C's eigenvalues mu_A' = ||A'v||^2, mu_B' = ||B'v||^2 and
    mu' = A'v . B'v are built from, and those primed eigenvalues -- NOT the raw
    ||A_hat v||^2 -- are what Theorem D.4's alpha (Eq 44) takes as input.

    The rank cutoff matters: with ESTIMATED operators the "zero" singular values
    sit at the noise floor, not at machine epsilon, so a cutoff of `eps` would
    classify noise directions as part of the range and shrink K to nothing. We
    cut relative to the largest singular value and expose `rtol` so its
    influence can be reported rather than hidden. This tolerance is load
    bearing: it alone decides dim K, and hence whether a reparametrisation is
    judged to exist at all.

    """Measure how far the real operators are from the isotropic regime.

    The Isotropic Regime definition asks that v be a common eigenvector of the
    four alignment products A^T A, A^T B, B^T B, B^T A, with

        A^T A v = mu_A v,  A^T B v = mu v,  B^T B v = mu_B v,  B^T A v = mu v.

    On real data this holds only approximately, so for each product M we report
    the *relative eigenvector defect*

        defect(M) = || M v - (v^T M v) v || / || M v ||,

    which is the sine of the angle between M v and v: it is 0 exactly when v is
    an eigenvector of M, and 1 when M v is orthogonal to v. This is the number
    that answers, on real data, the reviewers' question of how restrictive the
    isotropic regime actually is.

    We additionally compute d*, the minimum displacement to an isotropic
    reparametrisation (manuscript, Scope of the Isotropic Regime):

        A = A' + u_A v^T,   B = B' + u_B v^T,
        K  = ker(Pi_perp . A^T) cap ker(Pi_perp . B^T),
        d* = K_sup * ( ||Pi_{K^perp} A v|| + ||Pi_{K^perp} B v|| ),

    where Pi_perp is the projector onto Span{v}^perp inside R^{d_r} and K_sup is
    the radius sup ||r|| of the support. d* == 0 exactly when (A, B) is already
    isotropic, so d* quantifies the size of the perturbation the reparametrisation
    argument has to absorb into the noise.

    WHEN d* IS VACUOUS, AND WHY IT MUST BE FLAGGED
    ----------------------------------------------
    d* is only a measurement when the subspace K is non-trivial, and on
    ESTIMATED operators it very often cannot be. `_kperp_residual` builds

        M_stack = [Pi_perp A^T ; Pi_perp B^T]   of shape (2 d_r, d_s),

    and K is its null space, so

        dim K = d_s - rank(M_stack),    rank(M_stack) <= min(2 d_r, d_s).

    If d_s <= 2 d_r, the rank bound is d_s, and ridge-estimated A and B are
    full rank for any positive ridge penalty -- the estimate has no exact
    linear dependencies even when the population operators do. The rank then
    saturates at d_s, giving dim K = 0, K_basis empty, Pi_{K^perp} = I, and
    hence

        resid = ||A v|| + ||B v|| = scale   =>   d_star_relative == 1 EXACTLY.

    So on any run with d_s <= 2 d_r, d_star_relative is 1.0000 as a matter of
    arithmetic, whatever the operators look like. It is then reporting the
    `d_s >= 2 d_r` flag in disguise, not a distance to an isotropic
    reparametrisation, and the `rank_rtol` sweep cannot rescue it because the
    deficiency is in the SHAPE of M_stack rather than in where its singular
    values are cut. `d_star_informative` records this so a reader is never
    invited to interpret the pinned value.

    default and was never tuned. On these features that penalty is negligible,
    and the consequence is measurable: across seven different (d_r, n) shapes the
    permutation null mean matched

        -p / (n - p)      p = d_r, n = training-fold size

    to three significant figures -- the exact expected out-of-sample R^2 of
    UNREGULARISED least squares on pure noise. Examples: (108, 1804) predicted
    -0.0637, observed -0.0635; (769, 1804) predicted -0.7430, observed -0.7464;
    (363, 1804) predicted -0.2519, observed -0.2510.

    That identity means the estimator was behaving as plain OLS, so the reported
    "coupling" was a function of d_r/n rather than of the data: the same question
    returned 0.73 at d_r = 1063, 0.03 at d_r = 31 and -0.58 at d_r = 363 against
    513-row folds. Those numbers are not comparable to one another and none is an
    effect size.

    The penalty is tuned ONCE per cell on the observed data and then reused for
    the permutation null and the random-split control. Retuning inside the null
    would compare two different estimators; holding it fixed keeps the only
    difference between observed and null the thing being tested.

    because both blocks track the label y, and that is precisely the
    label-mediated situation, in which s is conditionally independent of r
    given (y, g). Feature-mediation is the claim that coupling SURVIVES
    conditioning on (y, g).

    Conditioning on the cell is exactly conditioning on (y, g): within a cell,
    y and g are constant, so any remaining predictive power of Phi_r for Phi_s
    is residual coupling and cannot be explained by label mediation.

    The null distribution is obtained by permuting the ROWS of Phi_s as a block
    within the cell. Block permutation destroys the pairing between r and s
    while preserving the internal covariance structure of the s-features, so
    the null accounts for dimensionality and for correlations among s-features.

    3498 / 184 / 56 / 1057: fitting a multi-output ridge from ~20 r-features
    inside a 56-sample cell yields an estimate whose error bar swamps its value.
    Cross-validation prevents that number from being spuriously HIGH, but it
    cannot create information -- the result simply becomes unstable across
    seeds while still printing to three decimals next to a p-value. The test
    split is constructed roughly balanced (~2255/2255/642/642), so the smallest
    cell is ~642 rather than 56.

    Cells below `min_cell` are therefore refused outright rather than reported,
    and cells between `min_cell` and `reliable_cell` are reported with an
    explicit warning attached.

    Returns per-cell held-out R^2, the null mean, an empirical p-value, and the
    pooled (marginal) R^2 for contrast.
