identify_rs.py -- Splitting a frozen representation into Phi_r and Phi_s.

BASIS AND RULE ARE SEPARATE
===========================
Identification involves two decisions that are easily confused.

  (1) THE BASIS -- which columns are the "features"?
        raw : the coordinates of Phi itself. Cheap, nothing to fit.
        SAE : the activations of a sparse autoencoder fitted to Phi
              (`fit_sae`). Slower, needs torch, but the columns are more
              monosemantic. Use when raw coordinates are polysemantic --
              i.e. when the raw run classifies most features as "weak".

  (2) THE RULE -- how is a column classified as r-type or s-type?
        two-concept : `two_concept_identify(cols, y, place)`
        sign-flip   : `sign_flip_identify(cols, concept, g)`

Neither rule requires an SAE: `two_concept_identify` works perfectly well on
raw coordinates, and `fit_sae` commits you to nothing. `analyze.py` therefore
exposes the basis as its only switch (`--sae`) and always runs BOTH rules on
whichever basis was chosen, reporting their agreement.

Whichever basis is chosen, the columns handed to a rule are written c_k below.
For the raw basis c_k is simply the k-th coordinate of Phi.

RULE 1 -- two-concept (preferred where the attribute is annotated)
==================================================================
Waterbirds annotates the spurious attribute directly: `metadata.csv` carries
`place` (land/water) next to `y` (landbird/waterbird). Each feature is
decomposed over the four (y, place) cells as a 2x2 factorial and classified by
which factor it responds to. This uses the annotation rather than inferring
around it. Full detail in `two_concept_identify`.

Requires: y and place. Not usable when the spurious attribute is unlabelled.

RULE 2 -- sign-flip (the Colored-MNIST rule; cross-check, or when `place` is absent)
===================================================================================
Let `concept` be the causal concept (digit class in Colored-MNIST; the bird
label y in Waterbirds). Define

    rho_0(k) = corr(c_k, concept | g = 0),
    rho_1(k) = corr(c_k, concept | g = 1).

A causal (r-type) feature tracks the concept itself, so its correlation has the
SAME sign in both groups. A spurious (s-type) feature tracks the group-dependent
attribute, whose relation to the concept REVERSES between groups, so its
correlation flips sign. Hence

    f_k is r-type  if rho_0 rho_1 > 0 and min(|rho_0|, |rho_1|) >= tau,
    f_k is s-type  if rho_0 rho_1 < 0 and min(|rho_0|, |rho_1|) >= tau,
    f_k is weak    otherwise.

This is the operational content of A != B in the manuscript's Definition
(features-mediated linear spurious correlation).

Requires: only y and the group index g -- so it still applies when the spurious
attribute is not annotated. `agreement()` compares the two rules' splits.

Why sign-flip still works on a binary concept
---------------------------------------------
A natural objection: Colored-MNIST had a quantitative concept (digit class)
with an explicitly inverted intensity map, whereas Waterbirds has a binary
label and nothing is "inverted" during image generation. Two answers:

  * With binary y, corr(c_k, y | g) is the point-biserial correlation, i.e. the
    standardised difference of class means within group g. Correlation needs
    variation, not ordinality, so the statistic is well defined.
  * The inversion IS present, but it comes from the group DEFINITION rather
    than from image generation. Waterbirds groups are g := 1[place != y], so
    conditioning on g fixes the background-label relation: place = y within
    g = 0 and place = -y within g = 1. A pure background feature therefore
    correlates positively with y in one group and negatively in the other. In
    Colored-MNIST the flip was engineered through the intensity map; here it is
    inherited from the standard majority/minority partition.

NOT GRAD-CAM, AND WHY
=====================
Grad-CAM produces a spatial saliency map over convolutional feature maps;
applied to a flat penultimate vector feeding a linear head it degenerates to
gradient-times-activation, and more importantly it answers the wrong question.
Attribution through the trained head identifies the coordinates the HEAD RELIES
ON, whereas the r/s split is defined by which factor a coordinate responds to.
A coordinate can be heavily relied upon and perfectly causal.

USAGE

A library, called by analyze.py; no CLI of its own. From the repository root:

    python -c "
    from common import FeatureBundle, standardize
    from identify_rs import two_concept_identify, sign_flip_identify, agreement
    b = FeatureBundle.load('features_waterbirds_test.npz')
    phi = standardize(b.phi)
    two  = two_concept_identify(phi, b.y, b.place)   # raw basis, two-concept
    flip = sign_flip_identify(phi, b.y, b.g)         # raw basis, sign-flip
    print(two['n_r'], two['n_s'], '|', flip['n_r'], flip['n_s'])
    print(agreement(two, flip, phi.shape[1]))

import numpy as np


def two_concept_identify(
    phi: np.ndarray,
    y: np.ndarray,
    place: np.ndarray,
    tau: float = 0.15,
    purity: float = 0.60,
) -> dict:
    """Split Phi using BOTH annotations directly -- the preferred rule.

    Waterbirds records the spurious attribute explicitly: `metadata.csv` carries
    `place` (0 = land, 1 = water) alongside `y` (0 = landbird, 1 = waterbird).
    The sign-flip rule below infers spuriousness indirectly, through the group
    definition; when the attribute is annotated there is no reason to do that.

    With both recoded to +/-1, each feature is decomposed over the four
    (y, place) cells as a 2x2 factorial:

        c_k = beta_0 + beta_y * y + beta_p * place + beta_int * (y * place).

    Four parameters for four cell means, so this is saturated -- an exact
    reparametrisation of the cell means, not an approximation. The coefficients
    are the standard contrasts, computed from UNWEIGHTED cell means m[a][b]:

        beta_0   = ( m[+][+] + m[+][-] + m[-][+] + m[-][-] ) / 4
        beta_y   = ( m[+][+] + m[+][-] - m[-][+] - m[-][-] ) / 4
        beta_p   = ( m[+][+] - m[+][-] + m[-][+] - m[-][-] ) / 4
        beta_int = ( m[+][+] - m[+][-] - m[-][+] + m[-][-] ) / 4

    Unweighted means matter: ordinary least squares would weight each cell by
    its size, and the waterbird-on-land cell (n = 56 in train) would be
    effectively ignored -- yet it is precisely the cell where y and place
    disagree, which is what makes the two effects separable at all.

    Classification, after scaling each feature by its pooled within-cell
    standard deviation so the coefficients are comparable across features:

        strength = sqrt(beta_y^2 + beta_p^2)          -- does the feature respond at all
        purity_r = |beta_y| / (|beta_y| + |beta_p|)   -- to which factor

        r-type if strength >= tau and purity_r >= purity
        s-type if strength >= tau and purity_r <= 1 - purity
        weak   otherwise

    `beta_int` is reported but not used for classification: a large |beta_int|
    marks a conjunction feature (responding to bird-on-mismatched-background),
    which is neither cleanly causal nor cleanly spurious and which the sign-flip
    rule would silently misfile.

    What beta_int actually is, in Waterbirds
    ----------------------------------------
    Worth stating explicitly, because it makes the diagnostic much easier to
    read. The groups are defined by g = 1[place != y], so with y and place both
    recoded to +/-1,

        y * place = +1  <=>  place agrees with y  <=>  g = 0,
        y * place = -1  <=>                           g = 1,

    i.e. the interaction regressor IS the group indicator, up to the affine map
    y*place = 1 - 2g. Substituting the cell means gives

        beta_int = 1/2 * [ (mean over the two g=0 cells)
                          - (mean over the two g=1 cells) ],

    the unweighted majority-minus-minority contrast. So a conjunction-dominated
    feature is one that responds to GROUP MEMBERSHIP more strongly than to bird
    type or to background separately -- a feature that is neither r nor s, and
    therefore one the manuscript's Phi = (r, s) partition has no slot for. That
    is why the count matters: it is the only quantity here that speaks to
    whether the two-block decomposition fits the representation at all.

    A caution the caller should propagate: y and place are strongly correlated
    on the train split (corr = 0.867), so beta_y and beta_p are identifiable but
    noisy -- variance inflation factor ~4 relative to a balanced design. The
    returned `se_approx` gives the approximate standard error shared by the
    contrasts, which is dominated by the smallest cell.

    Why the concordance carries an error bar
    ----------------------------------------
    `concordance_on_shared` is a proportion, and a proportion of 1.000 is only
    as strong as the sample it was measured on. With zero discordant features
    out of n, the rule of three puts a 95% upper bound of 3/n on the true
    discordance rate:

        n = 949  (raw basis)  ->  discordance could still be up to  0.3%
        n =  18  (SAE basis)  ->  discordance could still be up to 16.7%

    Both print as "concordance = 1.000", and they are not remotely the same
    claim. `concordance_reliable` is False below n = 60, the point at which the
    bound falls under 5%, so a small-sample 1.000 can never be quoted as though
    it were the large-sample one.
